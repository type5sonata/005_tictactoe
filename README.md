# Tic tac toe

This is a game that allows you to play tic tac toe against yourself. It implements functional programming principles (I think?). The code is very messy and need srefactoring. (Forgive me, I made this in about 2 hours.)

* Play tic tac toe in local multiplayer
* Refuses illegal moves
* Recognises win / lose / draw

An interesting future project would be a tic tac toe like game where you can choose the size of the board, winning conditions, player symbols... essentially a higher level of abstraction.
