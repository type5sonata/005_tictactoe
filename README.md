# Tic tac toe

This is a game that allows you to play tic tac toe against yourself. It implements functional programming principles (I think?). The code is very messy and need srefactoring.

An interesting future project would be a tic tac toe like game where you can choose the size of the board, winning conditions, player symbols... essentially a higher level of abstraction.
